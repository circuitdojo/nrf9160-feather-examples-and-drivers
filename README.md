# nRF9160 Feather Examples and Drivers

Zephyr examples and drivers for the nRF9160 Feather.

## Setup

1. Before you get started, you'll need to install the nRF Connect SDK. Here are the full instructions:

   * [Mac](https://docs.jaredwolff.com/nrf9160-sdk-setup-mac.html)
   * [Windows](https://docs.jaredwolff.com/nrf9160-sdk-setup-windows.html)
   * [Linux](https://docs.jaredwolff.com/nrf9160-sdk-setup-linux.html)

2. Initialize your repository using this Git url: `git@github.com:circuitdojo/nrf9160-feather-examples-and-drivers.git` and the **Zephyr Tools: Init Repo** command

	**Note:** It's best to select an empty folder to initialize the project to.

## Building and flashing the code

Using the command window run **Zephyr Tools: Build**

![Build](img/build.png)

If prompted select the project `nfed/samples/<sample name>` and type `circuitojo_feather_nrf9160_ns` as the target.

![Select project](img/select-project.png)

Then place the device into bootloader mode:
   1. Hold the MODE button
   2. Then tap the RST button while holding mode
   3. **Hold the MODE button until the Blue LED illuminates**

Then, load using the **Zephyr Tools: Load via Bootloader** task.

Pay attention to the progress in the bottom console.

Once complete, the extension will reset your device and should start executing!

## Viewing console output

You can then view the output using the **Zephyr Tools: Serial Monitor** command. You can also run **Zephyr Tools: Load via Booloader and Monitor** to both at the same time.

Make sure you select the port that corresponds to your device. On Mac the serial port will be `/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART`
