# nRF9160 Feather Examples and Drivers

Zephyr examples and drivers for the nRF9160 Feather.

## Setup

Once your environment is set up, you can initialize this repo anywhere on your machine. Here's an example for Mac OS

```
mkdir ~/ncs/
cd ~/ncs/
west init -m https://github.com/circuitdojo/nrf9160-feather-examples-and-drivers --mr main
west update
```

This will pull all Zephyr and Nordic dependencies to support all examples in this respository.
